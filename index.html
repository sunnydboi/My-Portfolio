        <!-- BIO -->
        <p>My name is Sandeep Sawhney. I am a young and energetic person. I love to learn and create! I have learned and used programming languages Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have built numerous web applications utilizing the flask tool integrated into Python. Also, recently I've been dedicating myself to JavaScript creating many fun little activities using the language. I dream of a world assisted by automation and that we can get anything with just the touch of a button. So with my passion for coding, creating, and learning, I shall work towards that goal, one program file at a time!</p>
